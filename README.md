# **Tetris** 

Fun & Simple Original tetris

Hi everyone, This is my first project. In this project, I will make Tetris using [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++) and [SDL 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).

If you want to study SDL 2.0 you can visit this [website](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php).

1. ### How to Download and Install the game

    First you will need to install [Code::Blocks](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/20.03/Windows/codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe/download) to run C++, follow the instruction on these links to install:  
        - [SDL 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)  
        - [SDL_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)  
        - [SDL_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)  
        - [SDL_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)  

    After installing, download as zip my project on github and then extract them.  

    Then open `Code::Blocks` then click `Open an existing project`. Move to the file where you extract the zip, open `Tetris.cbp`.

2. ### How to Play the game   

To play Tetris, you need to follow these basic steps:

Start the game: You can start the game by selecting the Tetris app or launching it on your device.

Understand the game board: The game board is a rectangular playing field that is 10 blocks wide and 20 blocks tall. You'll need to arrange the tetrominoes to fit within this playing field.

Control the tetrominoes: You can control the tetrominoes using the arrow keys on your keyboard or the touch screen on your device. You can move the tetrominoes left and right, rotate them, or make them fall faster.

Arrange the tetrominoes: As the tetrominoes fall from the top of the game board, you need to arrange them to fit into empty spaces on the board. You can rotate the tetrominoes to fit them into tight spaces or create complete horizontal lines.

Clear the lines: When you create a complete horizontal line, it disappears from the board, and you earn points. The more lines you clear at once, the more points you earn.

Continue playing: As you progress through the game, the tetrominoes will fall faster, and you'll need to react more quickly to keep the board from filling up completely.

End the game: The game ends when the tetrominoes reach the top of the game board, and there is no more room for new tetrominoes to fall.

Overall, Tetris is a game that requires quick reflexes and strategic thinking to succeed. With practice, you can improve your skills and achieve higher scores.
